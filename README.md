# Simple Quests
This branch provides an example of a quest datapack.

Downloading this as a zip and putting it in the datapack folder is enough to enable it.

It provides 3 example quests:

A quest (with id `example:fishing`) where you need to submit various fishes and get a buried treasure chest as reward.

A quest (with id `example:overworld_hostile`) with killing a few overworld mobs and giving 5 xp to get a custom loottable providing a single diamond.

A quest (with id `example:nether_hostile`) killing nether mobs and having the nether fortress advancement to get an end city chest.
